# Enginuity Backend (Node.js + Express)

## Project Description
Enginuity aims to aid engineering firms and the engineers + project managers who work there. This is acheived
by solving the issue of knowledge loss through our question bank, compartmentalizing critical project information, and
and documenting not just the what and the how, but the why behind every decision.

If a question hasn't been asked before, we'll get the question to the right person with our question routing program that genables your experts
to lead the way for the next experts.

## Technologies
- REST API
- **AWS S3, RDS, AND EC2** for file storage
